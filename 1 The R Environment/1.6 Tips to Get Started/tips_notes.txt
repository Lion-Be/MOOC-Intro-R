# Write short and consise object names
- they should be machine readable
	-> no spaces, punctuation, special characters
- they should be human readable
	-> contain information on what the object stores

# Write a maximum of 80 characters of code per line
- when analyses become more complex, code can become really long and messy
- sticking to a 80 character limit will help you understand what you did at any point of the analysis

# Name sections in your R script
- name sections in your R script such that you can navigate between sections without scrolling

# Indent your code by the arguments of a function 

# Use set.seed() for reproducability

# The best way to learn R is doing R
- not just do exercises of this course (although highly recommended)
- but just jump into your next data project using R
- stop doing things in Stata or SPSS because you know how they work there and are quicker
	-> yes they will be quicker in the beginning in the software program that you're most familiar with
	-> but the only way of learning and becoming fluent in R is to constantly try out new things
