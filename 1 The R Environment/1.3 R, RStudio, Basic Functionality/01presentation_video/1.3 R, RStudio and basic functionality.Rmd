# Basic R Functionality: Calculations

In it's very simplest form, R can just be used as a calculator. 

--

```{r, eval=T}
2+2
```
--

```{r, eval=T}
7^2
```

--

```{r, eval=T}
1/4
```

---

# Basic R Functionality: Comments

When writing code, you can distinguish between two distinct elements of a code chunk
- annotations (denoted by **#**) which will not be executed by R
- genuine code

--

```{r, eval=T}
# This is a comment 
5*30
```

--

```{r, eval=T}
print("Hello World") # This is an in-line comment
```

# Basic R Functionality: Philosophy of R

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

*"To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:*

- *Everything that exists is an object.*
- *Everything that happens is a function call."*

--- John Chambers, developer of R.

# Basic R Functionality: Functions

Functions are the workhorse of R programming. Functions take certain **inputs** as **arguments** and produces certain **outputs** given that all input arguments have been specified correctly. 

--

Let's look at the **sqrt** function: 

```{r, eval=T}
# calculate the square root of a number
sqrt(16)
```
--

In order to understand how exactly a function works and to **get help**, type

```{r, eval=F}
help(sqrt)
?sqrt
```

---

# Basic R Functionality: Arithmetic Functions 

This is an **overview** of R's built in arithmetic functions that take a single scalar as an input. 

- `log()`
- `exp()`
- `sqrt()`
- `sin()`
- `cos()`
- `tan()`

- `sum()`


- `round()`
- `ceiling()`
- `floor()`

]

# Basic R Functionality: Objects

Since R is an **object orientated programming language**, values (range of values, character strings, datasets, ...) can be stored in **objects**. This is done using the so-called **assignment operator <-**. An alternative would be using the **equality sign =**.

--

```{r, eval=T}
x <- 5 # a numerical object
chr <- "Exemplary character string."
```

--

Of course, the output of a function can also be assigned to an object. 
```{r, eval=T}
y <- sqrt(16)
y = sqrt(16) # identical
```

--

Objects can be assessed and printed to the **console** by simply typing their name or wrapping it around `print(object)`. 

```{r, eval=T}
y 
```

--

```{r, eval=T}
print(y) # identical
```

---

# R Packages

- **Packages** extend the basic functionality that comes with the installation of **(base) R**

--

- Packages are essentially **collections of functions** 
  - automate tasks for you that otherwise would need your own extensive coding in base R
  - provide documentations of their functions

--

- Packages can be directly installed from within R and are available via [The Comprehensive R Archive (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/)

--

- Working with packages requires a two-step process 

--

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("stringr") # installing package, only needs to be done once
library(stringr) # loading package, required in every R session
```

---

# An Exemplary Package: stringr
Let's have a look at an exemplary package. Let's first load it into our current R session using `library()` and inspect its documentation using `help()`.

```{r, eval=F}
library(stringr)
help(stringr)
```


.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/stringr.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

The **stringr** packes provides:

- cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible 

- fast implementations of common string manipulations

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, warning=F}
library(stringr)
```

```{r, eval=T}
model_string <- str_c("Model ", 1:4)
print(model_string)
```

# Tidyverse vs. Base R 

The **Tidyverse** has become so popular for data science in R that it provides substitutes for many common tasks that researchers face in their day-to-day work in R. This has led to a (friendly) **divide** in the R community where some try to rely on the **Tidyverse** as extensively as possible, whereas others prefer to code in **base R**. 

--

.pull-left[
**base R**

- allows for the full spectrum of R programming

- code can easily become long (like *really* long)

- often less readible

- code is built up from scratch 

- you are forced to understand problems and hard-code solutions for yourself

- stable code across time

]


.pull-right[
**Tidyverse**

- only focuses on a subset of common tasks

- code is usually clean and tidy

- often more readible

- set of ready-to-use functions

- quick fixes that are easy to implement even with little understanding

- introduces several dependencies, functionalities keep changing

]

--

Ultimately, you will develop your *own* **coding style** and **philosophy**.
