- R is an open-source (and free!) statistical .strong-highlight[programming language]

- R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics

- It's easily extensible and up to date with user-developed **packages**

- And has an amazing user community (getting help, tidytuesday etc.)

- Install from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

```
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an .strong-highlight[IDE] (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*

- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists and provides comprehensive support for writing R code:
    - Syntax highlighting,
    - Spellchecking,
    - Auto-completion and,
    - Better overview of files, libraries, created objects/output

- Install from [https://rstudio.com/](https://rstudio.com/)
