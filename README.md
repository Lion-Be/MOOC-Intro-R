# MOOC-Intro-R
## :star: Purpose 
This repository collects the material for the *Massive Open Online Course* **Introduction to R** that I am developing at the University of Mannheim. The course consists of an online-only program for self study and is facilitating students to learn R in their own pace without the need to redirect them to external service providers. I cover topics such as: 

- data manipulation and management (*dplyr*)
- logical and relational operators, control flow
- exploratory data analysis and visualization
- generalized linear models
- loops, functions, apply

## :bookmark_tabs: How is each module structured?
Each module is structured around three building blocks: 

- short video lecture discussing a theoretical topic 
- live coding video in R
- self-graded exercises with automatized feedback using `learnr` `shiny`

## :gem: Can you profit from it?
Sure, go ahead! Click on any particular module below to get started :metal:
